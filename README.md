# Binary-List
Binary list class created for those that want to create binary list in Python without coding from scratch.

## What is the idea of a binary list?
The objective of a binary list is to create sorted lists at using binary search and variations of binary search.\
This includes using binary search to find the index of an element in the binary list, deleting an element from the list,\
and insert elements into the list.

## Why create it?
Currently, sorting a list in Python using list.sort() has a run time of O(nlog(n)). A binary list is designed to insert elements into a list in ascending order, which nullifies the need to run the sort function. It is also used to attempt to insert and delete items in a list with an average time case of O(log(n)).
